# XtreamiOS-ATV2
Post-jailbreak(opensn0w) script for iOS 6.2.1

This script is for people who decide to use opensn0w to jailbreak their Apple TV 2.
(Use seas0npass if you want to jailbreak it easily)

This script currently doesn't include any of the patch that needs for it to run proporly because of the copyright reason, I will add the link to the patch later.

This does NOT install Cydia or nitoTV! If you decide to install nitoTV or Cydia, you can manually install it as this script include basic components for Cydia.
